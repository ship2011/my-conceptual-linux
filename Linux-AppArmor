What does AppArmor do?
Allow applications to do only what they are supposed to do.
deny everything else and AppArmor must know what to allow.

Why AppArmor?
Bug free and secure software would be ideal
Programmer can't perfrom magic
so better keep an eye on what they are doing.
AppArmor monitors applications at the  kernel level.

To create profile run below command
#aa-genprof /home/test/hello.sh
Now run your script on other session

now press S on aa-genprof screen
and then press I
Now press A to allow it

when done then press S and then finally finish it.

Now to check our profile details, please check this file
#cat /etc/apparmor.d/home.linux.scripts.hello

What does AppArmor do?
Monitor and restrict 
file access
network access
capabilities (chown,mknod,setuid,..)
man 7 capabilites
rlmit (aka ulimit)
In general restrict permission.

What doesn't AppArmor do?
replace traditional file permission
"chmod -R 777 / is not good idea

replace user permssions
run as little as possible as root

for webservers:
restrict Mysql database permssion
one mysql user per hosting and task
validate user input
validate input, escape input, php5-suhosin
============================================

Is my server secure now
Security consists of lots of small parts
AppArmor protects you from lots of exploits but not all
the server is definitely more secure

the AppAprmor tools
aa-status 
overview of loaded profiles and their usage

aa-unconfined
overview of protected/confied applications

aa-notify 
provides desktop notification and log summaries

aa-complain
switch profile to complain mode (allow everything, log what would be denied)

aa-enforce
switch profile to enforce mode (deny everything not explicitely allowed and log denials)

aa-disable
disable and unload profile

aa-audit
set or remove audit flag for a profile (log everything)

aa-logprof
update existing profiles based on logfile

aa-genprof
create a new profile

aa-autodep
create a very basic new profile (better use aa-genprof)

aa-easyprof
template-based profile generation

aa-mergeprof
merge two profiles into one

aa-cleanprof
cleanup profile, remove superfluous rules

aa-decode
translate log entries for filenames with special chars to human readable

aa-exec
execute a binary with the specified profile

File permssions
r-read
w-write
a-append
l-link
k-local
m-mmap (for libraries), typically also requires r
ix, Px, Cx, Ux, ...*execute

inherit (ix)
run program with the same profile
for helper application and shells (cat, grep, rm, bash)
also useful for rbac style confinement

child (Cx)
used for "foo called by bar"
doesn't confine standalone calls of foo
for helplers that need more or less permssions than the main application

profile (Px)
seprate profile for helpers
also used if the helper is called standalone
not a good idea for /bin/bash

unconfined(Ux)
execute helper applications without AppArmor protection
example: protect sshd, unrestricted shell after login

Fallback rules if profile doesn't exist
