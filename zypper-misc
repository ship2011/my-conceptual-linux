Zypper Commands
The simplest way to execute Zypper is to type its name, followed by a command. For
example, to apply all needed patches to the system, use:

tux > sudo zypper patch
Global Options
Additionally, you can choose from one or more global options by typing them immediately
before the command:
tux > sudo zypper --non-interactive patch

In the above example, the option --non-interactive means that the command is run
without asking anything (automatically applying the default answers).
