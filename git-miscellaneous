".git" direcotry id database or metadata about git repo.


Git commit will put directory content to tracking, so git commit command put working directory to staging area.

whenever you add any new file in repo directory then you will need to add it by "git add ." to add in tracked file from untracked file.

$git add .


To commit all added files run below commnad
$git commint -am "Adding doc in repo"

if you will run git log command then it will show you last 10 commit with commit ID
$git log


To filter specfic author commit (by name and email ID)
$git log --author="Dev Singh"

To clone specifc branch (-b and then give branch name which you want to clone)
$git clone -b main https://URL


if you want to add file and commit file in a single command and this command only commit the file which are tracked file. if you will create a new file and use this command then this will not commit new file.
$git commit -am "Commit message" 


How to setup auth between local machine and git hub account.

To switch to another branch
$git switch develop

TO check in which branch we are
$git branch

To create new branch in git
$git branch develop

To push created branch on remote
$git push origin develop

How merge branch in main (master) branch

firstly switch to main branch
$git switch main

$git pull

Now merge branch, here provide the name of the branch, which you want to merge
$git merge develop


Now push changes to remote repo
$git add .
$git status

$git commit
$git push


Git RESET - Practically, user can think of it is a "rollback"
   - Reset points local enviornment back to a previous commit (log history to previous commit)

   - Reset it will completely delete your previous commit and roll back.

Git REVERT - Net effect of the git revert command is similar to reset but it will add a new commit at the end of the chain to "cancel" changes.
    - Git revert is also reverting the changes but it will put new commit in logs.


If commit in the local then Reset is good, if commit is pushed then revert is good option.

To print git log in one line
$git log --oneline

To reset commit to previous commit
git soft reset will change only commit history log, not made changes in file

$git reset --soft gitid
$git log --oneline


Now If I want to reset change in git history as well as in git files

I will use hard reset, which will do both 
$git reset --hard gitid 

If I want to revet changed to previous git commit id
$git revert HEAD

$git push
or
For reverting changes to any commit ID
$git revert commitid

if you will see your commit then you can see new commit on the top
$git log --oneline

To check what changes are done in a file before git add and commit
$git diff filename

if you want to see what are changes between working aread and staging area
$git diff

How to identify diffrence between 2 commit

now lets identify changes between latest commit and any other old commitid
$git diff latestcommitid oldcommitid

To list all branches
$git branch -a

Switch branch in GIT to specfic branch
$git checkout branchname

Rename branch name
$git branch -m old_name new_name


After merging branch if you want to delete branch then you can run below command
$git branch -d branch_name


To check some graph based commit history
$git log --oneline --graph


To merge main branch to develop
$git merge main -m "Merging main to develop"

if we will update same file at same point (line) which we have updated in main branch then their will be merging conflict, in this situation we have to manualy select and confirm the code which we want to keep.


Git Stash:

Git stash save changes termprarily in working directory and index state WIP on main merging
$git stash
$git status


To check your all stash list
$git stash list

To apply your stash
$git stash apply

After resuming your stash and commiting it to repo you can delete created stash
$git stash drop

How to add new file also into git stash

$git stash -a

To remove git changs from stash
$git stash pop

To save only modified files
$git stash save "Change in 3rd files"

$git stash list


stash untracked file 
git stash -a save "change in new files"

To pop stash with name
$git stash list

$git stash pop stash@{1}

>>>>>>>>>>>>For Cloning branch>>>>>>>>>>>>>
$git clone -b master https://gitrepolink/
