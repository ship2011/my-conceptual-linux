TO check remote orgin repos
#git remote -v

TO remove remote origin repo
#git remote remove origin

#git remote -v

To update remote repos origin
#git remote add origin https://repourl

To push all our code to added remote origin URL
#git push -u origin --all

TO create new branch from existing repo
#git checkout -b new-feature

now you can check branch status
#git branch

now you can make your changes and push your branch changes to remote origin repo
#git push origin new-feature

Using Git Tags to Organize your repository ::-
Mark Specific points in repo history, Notate specific versions - v1.1 v1.2 etc. can also add notes on commit details.
so special name to commit we can call tags.

Adding lightweight tag
#git tag v1.2

Adding annotated tag
#git tag -a v1.2 -m "Update some templates"

Process to apply tags after making your changes::-
#git add .
#git commit -m "Updated code"
#git tag -a v1.1 -m "update some code"
To check our exsiting tags
#git tag
Now push changes to repo
#git push

now push your tag to repo
#git push origin v1.1

Why is git footpring size important
Cloning repo copies full history of all file versions.
Frequently updated large files - serious performance issues.

Git LFS (Large file system) ::
Large file management built into git.

Install GitLFS for your OS.
Initiate LFS on your local environment. #git lfs install

Tags files to be added to LFS before commiting them.
result in a .gitattributes file. # git lfs track "*.psd"

commit as usual. the remote repo will store tagged files seprarately.

removing repository data ::--
Local commit but not yet pushed : Bad commit on local environment but not yet pushed to remote repo. 
Solution :- Remove/amend bad local commit

Bad commit pushed to remote repo
Solution: Delete remote commit

Alternatively: Remove unwanted file history..with caveats.

Removing local commit before push (firstly delete the file)
#git rm --cached filename

Entirely delete commit
#git reset HEAD^

To amend previous commit
#git commit --amend -m "comment"


To Reset back to last pushed 'good' commit (to get SHA ID #git log --oneline)
#git reset --hard #commitSHA

To force push "remove commits" by above command.
#git push --force

To remove unwanted file from past commits' history
#c...

Recovering data from repository ::--
To resting backing to last good commit
#git reset --hard #commitSHA

To restore deleted branch, you can do it from Azure devops repo-branch but here you should know branch name.


Azure Pipelines##############################

what are Azure pipelines?
primary engine of both continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD)

Continuous integration -:
Automatically build and test code
Create deployable artifacts

Continuous Delivery -:
Automatically deploy to environments/end users

Pipeline Structure -:
Stages--> Jobs --> Steps

Trigger -: Automatically start pipeline in response to event.

Azure pipelines have 2 type YAML and Classic
Pipeline created using YAML
pipeline created using GUI (Classic)


Two Types of Agent :
1. Microsoft-Hosted Agent ::-
Microsoft provides a managed, on-demand VM for running a pipeline.
This is the simplest/default option.
Provides a clean VM on each build
Your must include dependency installs in the build file.
There are limits to machine sie, storage, and runtime.

2. Self-Hosted Agent
You provide (and manage) the computer pipeline used for builds:
 Azure VM/scale set
 Your own local machine
Useful for persistent configuration and greater control over dependencies.
You control machine specs, storage, and runtime.

Parallel Jobs ::-
Multiple Agents running jobs at the same time. set max number parallel agents in DevOps Organization.

Why use Self hosted Build Agents ?
Microsoft hosted agents limited to VM Size and 10 GB storage and NO GPU support.
With self hosted build agents you have more control over software configuration.

Assign Job to Agent Pool-
Microsoft-hosted pool assignment 
pool:
   vmImage: ubuntu-20-08

Self-hosted pool assignment
pool:
    name: 'Poolname'

To register self hosted pool below steps required
1- Create peronal access token for agent authentication
2- Install and configure self-hosted agent on your VM (during agent installation we will enter token)
3- Post install view agents in agent pool 


Trigger Types ::-
1. CI Trigger
2. Scheduled Trigger
3. Pipeline Trigger
4. PR (Pull Request) Trigger
